## Brand Voice & Tone

### Core Principles

**Expert, Not Arrogant**
We're knowledgeable security professionals, but we recognize that developers know their code best. Our voice should be authoritative without being condescending.

✅ Good: "We've identified a potential SQL injection vulnerability in this query builder."
❌ Bad: "Obviously, you shouldn't be building SQL queries this way."

**Clear, Not Jargon-Heavy**
Security terminology is unavoidable, but we explain concepts plainly and avoid unnecessary complexity.

✅ Good: "This endpoint is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) because user input isn't sanitized before rendering."
❌ Bad: "Unsanitized input vectors create exploitable XSS attack surfaces in the DOM."

**Helpful, Not Alarmist**
Security is serious, but fear-mongering doesn't help. We focus on practical solutions and risk-appropriate urgency.

✅ Good: "This critical vulnerability should be addressed before deployment. Here's how to fix it."
❌ Bad: "CRITICAL ALERT! Your application is completely exposed to attackers!"

**Collaborative, Not Judgmental**
Security bugs are learning opportunities, not moral failures. We partner with developers rather than blame them.

✅ Good: "Let's strengthen this authentication flow together."
❌ Bad: "This authentication implementation is completely wrong."

### Tone Variations by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Critical Vulnerabilities | Urgent but calm | "This requires immediate attention. We've outlined three mitigation steps below." |
| Medium/Low Findings | Informative, educational | "Consider adding input validation here to prevent potential edge cases." |
| Documentation | Professional, thorough | "SecureGuard AI analyzes your codebase using advanced pattern recognition..." |
| Marketing | Confident, aspirational | "Build secure software without slowing down." |
| Error Messages | Apologetic, solution-oriented | "We couldn't complete the scan. Let's troubleshoot together." |

## Messaging Guidelines

### Value Propositions

**For Developers:**
"Ship secure code faster with AI-powered security analysis that fits your workflow."

**For Security Teams:**
"Scale your security expertise across every pull request without becoming a bottleneck."

**For Engineering Leaders:**
"Build a security-first culture with tools that educate while they protect."

### Key Messages

1. **Intelligent Security Analysis**
   Our LLM-powered platform understands context, not just patterns, catching sophisticated vulnerabilities that traditional tools miss.

2. **Actionable Insights**
   Every finding includes clear explanations, severity ratings, and step-by-step remediation guidance.

3. **Developer Experience First**
   Security analysis integrated where developers already work: PRs, IDEs, and CI/CD pipelines.

4. **Continuous Improvement**
   The platform learns from your codebase, coding standards, and security policies over time.

### Words We Use

✅ **Embrace:** analyze, identify, protect, strengthen, collaborate, empower, guide, recommend, enhance, verify

❌ **Avoid:** hack-proof, unbreakable, foolproof, guarantee, eliminate (absolute claims)

## Writing Style

### General Guidelines

- **Active voice preferred:** "SecureGuard AI identifies vulnerabilities" not "Vulnerabilities are identified by SecureGuard AI"
- **Second person for instructions:** "You can configure custom security rules" not "Users can configure..."
- **Present tense for features:** "SecureGuard AI analyzes" not "will analyze"
- **Sentence case for headings:** "Getting started with SecureGuard AI" not "Getting Started With SecureGuard AI"

### Technical Writing

**Vulnerability Descriptions:**
```
[Severity] [Vulnerability Type] in [Location]

Description: [What the issue is and why it matters]
Risk: [Potential impact if exploited]
Recommendation: [Specific steps to fix]

Code Example: [Before/After when helpful]
```

**Example:**
```
HIGH: SQL Injection in user authentication

Description: User input from the login form is directly concatenated
into SQL queries without sanitization or parameterization.

Risk: Attackers could bypass authentication or access unauthorized data.

Recommendation: Use parameterized queries or an ORM to safely handle
user input.
```

### UI Copy

**Buttons:** Action-oriented, concise
- "Scan Repository" (not "Click Here to Scan")
- "Fix This Issue" (not "Remediate")
- "View Details" (not "More Info")

**Empty States:** Encouraging, next-step focused
- "No vulnerabilities found in this scan. Great work!"
- "Connect your first repository to get started with security analysis."

**Error Messages:** Explain what happened, what it means, how to fix
- "Scan failed: Repository access denied. Please check that SecureGuard AI has read permissions."

## Use Cases & Examples

### Marketing Copy Example

### Product Interface Example

**Vulnerability Card:**
```
🔴 CRITICAL

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in User Profile
src/components/UserProfile.tsx:42

User-provided biography text is rendered without escaping,
allowing malicious scripts to execute in other users' browsers.

Impact: Account takeover, data theft, malicious actions

📋 Recommended Fix:
1. Use React's default JSX escaping (already safe for {variable})
2. If you need to render HTML, use DOMPurify to sanitize input
3. Consider implementing a Content Security Policy
